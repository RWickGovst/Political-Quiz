                        <h2>Constitution Party</h2>
                        <p> The Constitution Party, previously known as the U.S. Taxpayers' Party, is a national
                            political party in the United States. The idea that the principles and intents of the U.S.
                            Constitution remain relevant in human relations was the origin of the 1991 founding.
                            Founding members included 2016 presidential candidate Darrell Castle and former acting
                            Office of Economic Opportunity Director Howard Phillips. The party platform is based on
                            originalist interpretations of the Constitution and shaped by principles it finds set forth
                            in the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution and the Bible.

                            There are "7 Guiding Principles" for Constitution Party candidates and platforms. Throughout
                            these principles and accompanying platform items are direct quotes from early U.S. founders
                            and political figures, the U.S. Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and the U.S.
                            Declaration of Independence, among others. The party applies these quotes as evidence of
                            their views of the Constitution and how the U.S. is founded on Christian principles while
                            maintaining their support of the No Religious Test Clause.

                            As of March 2018, the Constitution Party has 26 members elected to city council seats and
                            other municipal offices across the United States. In terms of registered members, the party
                            ranks fifth among national parties in the United States</p>

                        <h2>Democratic Party</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United
                            States, along with its rival, the Republican Party. Tracing its heritage back to Thomas
                            Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party
                            was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active
                            political party.

                            In its early years, the Party supported limited government, state sovereignty and opposed
                            banks and the abolition of slavery. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition
                            in the 1930s, the Democratic Party has promoted a social liberal platform. Well into the
                            20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and Southern conservative-populist
                            wings; following the New Deal, however, the conservative wing of the party largely withered
                            outside the South. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters
                            of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After the
                            Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the core bases of the two
                            parties shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential
                            politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. The once-powerful
                            labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s. White evangelicals
                            and Southerners have become heavily Republican at the state and local level since the 1990s.
                            People living in urban areas, women, college graduates, sexual and gender minorities,
                            millennials, and Black, Latino, Jewish, and Asian Americans tend to support the Democratic
                            Party.

                        <h2>Green Party</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Green Party of the United States (GPUS) is a green federation of political parties in
                            the United States. The party promotes green politics, specifically environmentalism;
                            nonviolence; social justice; participatory, grassroots democracy; gender equality; LGBT
                            rights; anti-war and anti-racism. On the political spectrum, the party is generally seen as
                            left-wing.

                            The GPUS was founded in 2001 as the evolution of the Association of State Green Parties
                            (ASGP), which was formed in 1996. After its founding, the GPUS soon became the primary
                            national green organization in the country, eclipsing the Greens/Green Party USA (G/GPUSA),
                            which formed in 1991 out of the Green Committees of Correspondence (CoC), a collection of
                            local green groups active since 1984.[11] The ASGP had increasingly distanced itself from
                            the G/GPUSA in the late 1990s.

                            The Greens gained widespread public attention during the 2000 presidential election, when
                            the ticket composed of Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke won 2.7% of the popular vote. Nader was
                            vilified by many Democrats and even some Greens, who accused him of spoiling the election
                            for Al Gore, the Democratic candidate. Nader maintains that he was not a spoiler in the 2000
                            election.

                        <h2>Libertarian Party</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Libertarian Party (LP) is a political party in the United States that promotes civil
                            liberties, non-interventionism, laissez-faire capitalism and shrinking the size and scope of
                            government. The party was conceived at meetings in the home of David F. Nolan in
                            Westminster, Colorado in August 1971 and was officially formed on December 11, 1971 in
                            Colorado Springs, Colorado. The founding of the party was prompted in part due to concerns
                            about the Nixon administration, the Vietnam War, conscription and the end of the gold
                            standard.

                            The party generally promotes a classical liberal platform, in contrast to the Democratic
                            Party's modern liberalism and progressivism and the Republican Party's conservatism. Gary
                            Johnson, the party's presidential nominee in 2012 and 2016, states that the Libertarian
                            Party is more culturally liberal than Democrats, and more fiscally conservative than
                            Republicans. Current fiscal policy positions include lowering taxes, abolishing the Internal
                            Revenue Service (IRS), decreasing the national debt, allowing people to opt out of Social
                            Security and eliminating the welfare state, in part by utilizing private charities. Current
                            cultural policy positions include ending the prohibition of illegal drugs, advocating
                            criminal justice reform, supporting same-sex marriage,ending capital punishment and
                            supporting gun ownership rights.

                            While it is currently the third largest political party in the United States by voter
                            registration, it currently has no members in Congress, or governorships, and over the past
                            decade, has had less than 10 members elected to state legislatures or other state office.

                        <h2>Republican Party</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party), is one of the two major
                            political parties in the United States; the other is its historic rival, the Democratic
                            Party.

                            The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed for the
                            potential expansion of slavery into certain U.S. territories. The party supported classical
                            liberalism, opposed the expansion of slavery, and supported economic reform. Abraham Lincoln
                            was the first Republican president. Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican
                            Congress, slavery was banned in the United States in 1865. The Party was generally dominant
                            during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System. After 1912, the Party underwent
                            an ideological shift to the right. Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting
                            Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with Southern states becoming more
                            reliably Republican in presidential politics. Since the 1990s, the Party's support has
                            chiefly come from the South, the Great Plains, the Mountain States and rural and exurban
                            areas in the Midwest.
